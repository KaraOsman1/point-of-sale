to create a point of sale system for a hospital that includes doctor's fee, ward fee, medicine fee, and a database to store in-patient and out-patient details. Here are the general steps you can follow:

    Define the requirements of the system, including the necessary features and functionality.

    Choose a programming language to use. For example, you can use Python, Java, or C#.

    Choose a database management system to store the patient data. For example, you can use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

    Create a user interface for the system that allows the user to enter patient details and select the services they require, such as doctor's fee, ward fee, and medicine fee.

    Implement the necessary backend functions to handle the user inputs and calculate the total cost of the services selected.

    Implement the necessary database operations to store the patient data, including in-patient and out-patient details.

    Test the system to ensure that it is working as expected.

Here is an example of how you can implement the point of sale system in Python, using a Flask web application framework and MySQL as the database management system.

    Install the necessary Python modules, including Flask, Flask-MySQLdb, and WTForms.

    Define the database schema for the system, including tables for patients, doctors, and services.

    Create a user interface for the system using HTML and CSS.

    Implement the necessary backend functions using Python and Flask to handle the user inputs and calculate the total cost of the services selected.

    Implement the necessary database operations using Python and Flask-MySQLdb to store the patient data, including in-patient and out-patient details.

    Test the system to ensure that it is working as expected.

Here is an example of a Python code snippet that shows how to insert patient data into a MySQL database:
